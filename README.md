# Automation-server-test

This code provide tests that validate and testing entire tools provided for Map Colonies services: raster only [for current version]:

### Deploy:
#### Docker:
- Run build.sh script to generate docker image of this test suite.from project directory: [CMD]\
`` ./build.sh``
- Add DUMP_IMAGE=1 param to export .tar file of created image
- Output folder will be created with "generated_dockers.txt" that save current docker image name:tag

- current version include direct running for raster tests -> will be changed on future

#### Wheels and packages:
- This project can be installed as python's package:
    - Install cloned ropo into environment (recommended with virtual env)\
    ``pip install .``\
    It will install to environment all dependencies [On network]
    - To dump package as wheel [from rep root dir - where the setup.py located:\
    ``python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel``
*** 
### Raster
 - Exporter tools - server side test cases:
   - Exporting data as geopackage with best layer
   - Export according restricted region size of geoPackage
   - Deletion of old packages after configurable time period -TBD [not implemented yet]
   - Package created on shared folder
   - Download locally package from shared storage
   
   ##### usage:
   1. To run functional testing on exporter tool:\
   ``pytest server_automation/tests/test_exporter_tools.py``
   2. Logging:\
        1.``Add  variable <DEBUG_LOGS=1> for debog logging level``\
        2.``Add variable <FILE_LOGS=1> to write logs into file beside consule``\
        3.``Add variable <LOGS_OUTPU=/tmp/directory/for/logs>``
   3. Choose storage method - S3 OR File System:\
   ``Add the variable <S3_EXPORT_STORAGE_MODE=True> for S3 mode or False for file system``
   4. if you choose S3 mode you should provide following variable on running:
        1. ``S3_ACCESS_KEY=<aws access key>``
        2. ``S3_SECRET_KEY=<aws secret key>`` 
        3. ``S3_END_POINT=<provided valid aws endpoint>``
        4. ``S3_BUCKET_NAME=<relevant bucket>``
        5. ``S3_DOWNLOAD_DIR=<temp directory> - as default ->/tmp/``
   5. In case running test with File system option\
   ``OUTPUT_EXPORT_PATH=<relevant directory mounted to worker's output dir - relative>``
   6. In case running with jira update: \
   ``pytest server_automation/tests/test_exporter_tool_jira.py``\
        * should provide all relevant credential on jira_config.json file and right directory to JIRA_CONF environment variable
        1. account_id
        2. access_key
        3. secret_key
        4. jwt_exp_in_sec
        5. cloud_base_url [will be https://prod-api.zephyr4jiracloud.com/connect/]
        6. version_id
        7. project_id [inspected from jira for relevant project]
        8. cycleId [inspected from jira for relevant project]
        9. Jira_API_token [ generated by user]
